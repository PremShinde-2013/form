**README - Simple Form with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

This is a basic README file for a simple form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to input their name and email address and submit the form to a server. Below are the details and instructions to use the form:

### Files Included:
1. index.html - Contains the HTML structure and form elements.
2. style.css - Contains the CSS styles for the form and page layout.
3. script.js - Contains the JavaScript code to handle form validation and submission.

### Instructions:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser. You can do this by simply double-clicking the file.

3. The form will be displayed on the page, consisting of two input fields (name and email) and a submit button.

4. Fill in your name and email address in the respective fields.

5. Once the form is filled, click the "Submit" button to validate and submit the form.

6. The JavaScript code will handle form validation to ensure both the name and email fields are filled in before submitting.

### Dependencies:
No external libraries or frameworks are used in this simple form. It is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Browser Compatibility:
The form should work on all modern web browsers, including but not limited to Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, for Internet Explorer, some features might not be fully supported due to the use of modern JavaScript features.

### Customization:
Feel free to customize the form's appearance and behavior by modifying the CSS styles in the style.css file. You can also change the form validation logic or add more form fields in the script.js file according to your requirements.

### Note:
This form is meant to be a basic template and does not include server-side handling. If you want to handle form submissions on the server-side, you'll need to implement appropriate backend code to process the form data.
